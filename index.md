# Sample analysis of Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) data 
## Request
* Identify the most frequent genetic alterations (could be mutations or copy number variations) in the cancer cell lines
* Match them with the best genetic dependencies that could be used for drug development for the cancers that carry those mutations
* Take into account the lineage of cancer cell lines (certain mutations/CNVs may be restricted to a specific lineage)

## Resources
### DepMap (https://depmap.org/portal) Data 
* Cell line metadata
* Expression (RNASeq)
* Copy number variation
* Mutations
* Genetic dependency
  * Crispr (Achilles)
  * RNAi (DEMETER2)

## Analysis overview
1. Aggregate data from depmap.org
2. Deal with various data format issues
3. Map cell lines to cancer lineages and sublineages
4. Capture low-hanging fruit genes with high copy number and gene dependency (Achilles Crispr) scores < 0
5. Sanity check filters using ERBB2 as a known truth
6. Compare RNAi and Crispr gene dependency data
7. Plot copy number vs. gene dependency by lineage
8. Generate list of candidate genes as a sortable table
9. Add cross-validation/filtering data for RNAi, expression, TGCA/COSMIC mutation hotspots
10. target gene info pages

## Next steps
1. Improve thresholds (cutoffs for copy number, gene dependency, expression TPMs, etc.)
2. Integrate chemical sensitivity data
3. Use pathways, networks etc (eg: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40780-7) to group targets
4. Filter genes that are already known drug targets (identify truly novel targets)

## Aggregate CCLE cell lines by lineage
<b>DepMap source file:</b> sample_info.csv
* Group all cell lines (CCLE cell line IDs) by main (parent) lineage
* If a lineage has > 1 defined sublineages, also aggregate cell lines by sublineage (eg: leukemia -> AML)

<pre>
Number of cell lines: 1429
Number of lineages: 33
Number of lineages with sub-lineages: 16
Number of sub-lineages 61
</pre>

## Expression Data (RNASeq)
RNAseq TPM gene expression data for just protein coding genes using RSEM. Log2 transformed, using a pseudo-count of 1.

<b>DepMap source file:</b> CCLE_expression.csv
* Transpose columns (gene names) and rows (CCLE cell line IDs)
* Translate gene names to NCBI gene IDs


## Mutation Data 
<b>DepMap source file:</b> CCLE_mutations.csv
* Keep track of TCGA and COSMIC hotspot genes by lineage
* Just using hotspot genes for now but track deleterious mutations by lineage for future reference

8704 TCGA or COSMIC hotspot genes

## Copy number data
Gene level copy number data, log2 transformed with a pseudo count of 1. This is generated by mapping genes onto the segment level calls.

<b>Depmap source file:</b> CCLE_gene_cn_v2.csv
* Transpose columns (gene names) and rows (CCLE cell line IDs)
* Translate gene names to NCBI gene IDs


## Search for high copy number genes in each of the lineages
* Filtering only genes with copy number > 2 in <b><i>all</i></b> cell lines in a lineage is a bit too stringent
* Retain genes that have copy number >= 2 in 80% or more cell lines in a lineage
* Extract the data for any cell lines with high copy number genes to use as plotting baseline

## DEMETER2 RNAi gene dependency data
Cancer cell line genetic dependencies estimated using the DEMETER2 model. DEMETER2 is applied to three large-scale RNAi screening datasets: the Broad Institute Project Achilles, Novartis Project DRIVE, and the Marcotte et al. breast cell line dataset. The model is also applied to generate a combined dataset of gene dependencies covering a total of 712 unique cancer cell lines.

<b>DepMap source file:</b> D2_combined_gene_dep_scores.csv 

* Data source uses CCLE names rather than DepMap cell line IDS
* Translate the cell line names to IDS for consistency with other data sources
* Also deal with rows in the table with multiple gene names (eg 'GTF2IP4&GTF2IP1 (100093631&2970)')


## Achilles Crispr gene dependency data
CERES data with principle components strongly related to known batch effects removed, then shifted and scaled per cell line so the median nonessential KO effect is 0 and the median essential KO effect is -1.

<b>DepMap source file:</b> Achilles_gene_effect.csv 

* Translate gene names (column labels) to NCBI IDS
* Transpose rows and columns so each cell line is a column label with vertivally stacked gene data


### How many cell lines and genes are shared between D2 (RNAi) and Achilles (Crispr) gene dependency data sets?

<pre>
423 cell lines are shared
16052 genes are shared
</pre>

### How well do VCrispr and RNAi compare
<img src="plots/gene_dependency.png">
* significant p-value means reject H0 that slope == 0
* For now, accept Achilles (Crispr) as canonical for gene dependency score but keep RNAi data fro cross-validation/concordance

### Sanity checking with ERBB2 (2064)
Do my filters capture a known target?
* Evaluating breast cancer lineages where at least one cell line had copy number > 2:
* Is ERB2B in the hotspot gene set?
* We expect ERBB2 to have high copy number in breast cancer lineages
  ** What is the mean ERB2B copy number in breast cancers?
* The gene dependency score should be < 0
  ** What is the mean gene dependency score in breast cancers?

ERBB2 is in hotspot gene set? <b>TRUE</b>
<pre>
ERBB2 mean copy number for breast_TNBC (27 cell lines): 1.89
ERBB2 mean copy number for breast_TPBC (5 cell lines): 9.59
ERBB2 mean copy number for breast_HER2Amp (11 cell lines): 14.84
ERBB2 mean gene dependency for breast_HER2Amp (6 cell lines): -0.83
ERBB2 mean gene dependency for breast_ERpos (7 cell lines): -0.27
ERBB2 mean gene dependency for breast_TNBC (15 cell lines): -0.28
</pre>

## Lineages with observed high copy number genes

* Go through the list of lineages with high copy number genes
* Plot gene dependency vs. copy number
* Highlight genes/cell-lines with copy number > 2 and gene dependency < 0 for specific lineages

## Candidate target genes

* All genes in this table have copy number > 2 and Achilles gene dependency < 0 for at least 80% of the cell lines in 1 cell lineage
* Other data for cross-validation:
  * RNAi gene dependency score
  * Whether the gene is a TCGA or COSMIC mutation hotspot
  * Whether the gene has > 0 TPM RNASeq expression
