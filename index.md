# Sample analysis of Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) data 
## Request
* Identify the most frequent genetic alterations (could be mutations or copy number variations) in the cancer cell lines
* Match them with the best genetic dependencies that could be used for drug development for the cancers that carry those mutations
* Take into account the lineage of cancer cell lines (certain mutations/CNVs may be restricted to a specific lineage)

## Resources
### DepMap (https://depmap.org/portal) Data 
* Cell line metadata
* Expression (RNASeq)
* Copy number variation
* Mutations
* Genetic dependency
  * Crispr (Achilles)
  * RNAi (DEMETER2)

### NCBI (via https://humanmine.org)
* Entrez gene IDs mapped to symbol, name, descrion, uniprot

### Reactome
* Entrez gene IDs mapped to Reactome pathways

### MFR (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/MFR)
* A Machine Learning Model for measuring relatedness between a pair of genes

### Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/)
* Python programming framework for analysis prototyping and reporting

### GitHub (https://github.com/)
* Revision control for Python code
* Reporting mechanism for analysi summary and details
