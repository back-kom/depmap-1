# Sample analysis of Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) data 
## Request
* Identify the most frequent genetic alterations (could be mutations or copy number variations) in the cancer cell lines
* Match them with the best genetic dependencies that could be used for drug development for the cancers that carry those mutations
* Take into account the lineage of cancer cell lines (certain mutations/CNVs may be restricted to a specific lineage)

      <td>The protein encoded by this gene is a glycogen branching enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of alpha-1,4-linked glucosyl units from the outer end of a glycogen chain to an alpha-1,6 position on the same or a neighboring glycogen chain. Branching of the chains is essential to increase the solubility of the glycogen molecule and, consequently, in reducing the osmotic pressure within cells. Highest level of this enzyme are found in liver and muscle. Mutations in this gene are associated with glycogen storage disease IV (also known as Andersen's disease).

## Aggregate cell lines by lineage
<b>DepMap source file:</b> sample_info.csv
* Group all cell lines by main (parent) lineage
* If a lineage has > 1 defined sublineages, also aggregate cell lines by sublineage (eg: leukemia -> AML)

<pre>
Number of cell lines: 1429
Number of lineages: 33
Number of lineages with sub-lineages: 16
Number of sub-lineages 61
</pre>

## Mutation Data 
<b>DepMap source file:</b> CCLE_mutations.csv
* Keep track of TCGA and COSMIC hotspot genes by lineage
* Track deleterious mutations by lineage for future reference


## DEMETER2 RNAi gene dependency data
Cancer cell line genetic dependencies estimated using the DEMETER2 model. DEMETER2 is applied to three large-scale RNAi screening datasets: the Broad Institute Project Achilles, Novartis Project DRIVE, and the Marcotte et al. breast cell line dataset. The model is also applied to generate a combined dataset of gene dependencies covering a total of 712 unique cancer cell lines.

* Data source uses CCLE names rather than DepMap cell line IDS
* Translate the cell line names to IDS for consistency with other data sources
* Also deal with rows in the table with multiple gene names (eg 'GTF2IP4&GTF2IP1 (100093631&2970)')


## Achilles Crispr gene dependency data
CERES data with principle components strongly related to known batch effects removed, then shifted and scaled per cell line so the median nonessential KO effect is 0 and the median essential KO effect is -1.

* Translate gene names (column labels) to NCBI IDS
* Transpose rows and columns so each cell line is a column label with vertivally stacked gene data
